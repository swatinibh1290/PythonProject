Questions for class:

Ask clarifying questions about the file path issues we found today, if needed.

"What is displayed when you choose option 1 Search Stock?" (Just current info? Current and all past info?)

"What should we use, uni testing? or ticker? to test our code?"

"Do you have any tips for our group on making a flow diagram for our code?"



      Then just a reminder for Me( Emma )...
      "What command window is best, Powershell... CMD.exe... Regular... does it make a difference?" 
      "What should I do if my anaconda apps wont launch? Go to IT?"
